PBK-ImageViewSlider
===================

This is our first .NET desktop component. This component is created using vb.NET during Component Oriented Programming lecture in Duta Wacana Christian University (Universitas Kristen Duta Wacana). With this component you can add a great Image View Slider to your desktop application form (for example online game advertisement at login sesion) without big effort.
With this image viewer you can get any local or internet based URL so it can appear to this component as Memory Stream.
There are some simple fade out effect on this component that really possible for improvement. We glad if you are interested on this, and hope for some creative improvement.

Try this out!
